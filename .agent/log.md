# Autonomous improvement agent log

This file is appended once per 30-minute cycle by the recurring cron job.
State machine lives in .agent/state.json (consecutive_no_improvement counter,
full implemented/rejected history). Do not hand-edit; the agent owns this file.

## Cycle 1 — 2026-09-09T02:00:00Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
(all `completed`/`success`, 44s-89s runtimes). Grepped logs for warnings/errors/
429/throttle signals excluding known-benign Node 20 deprecation noise — none
found. All sources (CISA KEV, NVD, FIRST.org EPSS, GHSA) healthy, no backoff
signals. Proceeded with normal candidate search.

**Implemented:** Retry-with-backoff on `fetch_kev()` and `fetch_epss()` in
`scripts/aggregate.py`. Both previously made a single bare HTTP attempt with no
retry, unlike `nvd_query()` which already retries 3x with exponential backoff on
429/5xx. A transient failure on either call would silently zero out KEV status
(losing the +25 risk-score bonus applied to every KEV-listed alert) or EPSS
scores (40% weight in the composite risk score) for the entire run, degrading
scoring accuracy with no visible error — a pure reliability/accuracy fix, zero
new dependencies, zero added API call volume under normal conditions (extra
calls only fire on genuine failure). Scored 5/5/5 on feasibility/risk/value:
free (no new API usage), low validation risk (mirrors an existing, proven
pattern in the same file), directly serves the "accuracy over feature breadth"
priority.

Validation performed: `ast.parse` syntax check passed. Backed up
`docs/data/{alerts,seen_ids,stats}.json`, `docs/data/history/`,
`docs/feed.{json,xml}`, `docs/data/kev_snapshot.json` to `/tmp/cve_backup`,
then ran `scripts/aggregate.py` for real against live APIs (LOOKBACK_DAYS=2):
KEV catalog 1699 entries, 587 NVD candidates, EPSS batch queried, 432 total
alerts written, 0 schema warnings, clean exit. Also unit-verified the new
retry branch specifically by monkey-patching `http_get_json` to raise a
synthetic HTTP 503 on the first CISA KEV call — confirmed the code logged
"retrying in 5s (attempt 1/3)" and succeeded on the second attempt (1699
entries returned). Ran `git checkout --` on all throwaway local test-run data
files afterward so no test output touched committed production data (the
live Actions run regenerates real data after push). No frontend files
changed, so no local server/browser validation was needed.

Committed as `f4428be`, pushed to main, triggered
`gh workflow run cve-alerts.yml` (run 34301343226) — completed `success` in
~50s with no new warnings/errors (only the pre-existing benign Node 20
deprecation notice). Pulled latest and curled the live site:
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/` → 200,
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/data/stats.json` → 200. Live verification
passed; no revert needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none — the one candidate identified cleared the bar
and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles = 0/3.
Not stopped. Next cycle in ~30 minutes.

## Cycle 2 — 2026-09-09T02:38:03Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
(all `completed`/`success`, 52s-1m29s runtimes). Grepped the latest run's logs
for warnings/errors/429/throttle signals excluding known-benign Node 20
deprecation noise — none found. All sources (CISA KEV, NVD, FIRST.org EPSS,
GHSA, Dependabot) healthy, no backoff signals observed.

**Implemented:** Retry-with-backoff on `fetch_dependabot_alerts()`'s per-page
HTTP fetch in `scripts/aggregate.py`. After cycle 1's fix to `fetch_kev()`/
`fetch_epss()`, this was the last remaining external call in the pipeline
still making a single bare attempt with no retry, unlike `nvd_query()` and the
now-fixed KEV/EPSS calls. `dependabot_repos` in `config/watchlist.yaml`
actively lists `astruzocyber/CVE` (not a dead/example config path), so a
transient 429/5xx/network blip on any page mid-pagination would silently
truncate or drop that repo's Dependabot alerts for the entire run with no
visible error. Added the same 3-attempt exponential-backoff pattern already
proven in cycle 1: 429/5xx retried with increasing backoff, other HTTP status
codes and exhausted-retry cases still log a WARNING and end pagination for
that repo (matching prior behavior on genuinely unrecoverable failure — no
change to what counts as a hard stop, only added resilience to transient
ones). Scored 5/5/5 on feasibility/risk/value: free (no new API usage, retries
only fire on actual failure), low validation risk (mirrors an existing proven
pattern in the same file, touches only one function), improves data
completeness which the user explicitly prioritizes over feature breadth.

Validation performed: `ast.parse` syntax check passed. Backed up
`docs/data/{alerts,seen_ids,stats}.json`, `docs/data/history/`,
`docs/feed.{json,xml}`, `docs/data/kev_snapshot.json` to `/tmp/cve_backup`,
then ran `scripts/aggregate.py` for real against live APIs (LOOKBACK_DAYS=2,
using a real Dependabot-scoped token via `gh auth token` so the modified code
path was genuinely exercised, not skipped): KEV catalog 1699 entries, 587 NVD
candidates, Dependabot query for astruzocyber/CVE executed cleanly (0 open
alerts — expected, no crash/warning), EPSS batch queried, 432 total alerts
written, 0 schema warnings, clean exit. Ran `git checkout --` on the
throwaway local test-run data files (`trend.csv`, `stats.json`) afterward so
no test output touched committed production data (the live Actions run
regenerates real data after push). No frontend files changed, so no local
server/browser validation was needed.

Committed as `8e94e2d`, pushed to main, triggered
`gh workflow run cve-alerts.yml` (run 34303991054) — completed `success` in
1m3s with no new warnings/errors (only the pre-existing benign Node 20
deprecation notice). Pulled latest and curled the live site:
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/` → 200,
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/data/stats.json` → 200. Live verification
passed; no revert needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none — the one candidate identified cleared the bar
and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles = 0/3.
Not stopped. Next cycle in ~30 minutes.

## Cycle 3 — 2026-09-09T03:20:57Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
(all `completed`/`success`, 52s-1m29s runtimes). Grepped the latest run's logs
for warnings/errors/429/throttle signals excluding known-benign Node 20
deprecation noise — none found. All sources (CISA KEV, NVD, FIRST.org EPSS,
GHSA, Dependabot) healthy, no backoff signals observed.

**Implemented:** Retry-with-backoff on `fetch_ghsa_advisories()`'s per-package
HTTP fetch in `scripts/aggregate.py`. This was the last remaining external
call in the pipeline still making a single bare attempt with no retry, after
cycles 1-2 already brought `fetch_kev()`/`nvd_query()`/`fetch_epss()`/
`fetch_dependabot_alerts()` up to the same 3-attempt exponential-backoff
pattern. `ghsa_packages` is currently empty in `config/watchlist.yaml`, so
this function is a no-op in the live pipeline today, but it is live
production code that activates the moment the user adds a package name —
leaving it as the one unretried path was an inconsistency that would
silently degrade data completeness the day it's actually used. Added the
identical pattern: 429/5xx retried with increasing backoff, other HTTP status
codes and exhausted retries logged as a WARNING and skip that package
(matching prior behavior on genuinely unrecoverable failure). Scored 5/5/5 on
feasibility/risk/value: free (no new API usage, retries only fire on actual
failure), low validation risk (mirrors an existing proven pattern, touches
only one function), completes the reliability layer across every external
source the pipeline can call.

Validation performed: `ast.parse` and `yaml.safe_load` syntax checks passed.
Backed up `docs/data/{alerts,seen_ids,stats}.json`, `docs/data/history/`,
`docs/feed.{json,xml}`, `docs/data/kev_snapshot.json` to `/tmp/cve_backup`,
then ran `scripts/aggregate.py` for real against live APIs (LOOKBACK_DAYS=2,
using a real Dependabot-scoped token via `gh auth token`): KEV catalog 1699
entries, 593 NVD candidates, Dependabot query for astruzocyber/CVE executed
cleanly (0 open alerts), EPSS batch queried, 436 total alerts written, 0
schema warnings, clean exit, no crash. GHSA path itself wasn't exercised
(empty `ghsa_packages` list means the function returns early with no
network calls either before or after this change), but the modified code is
syntactically valid and structurally identical to the already-proven pattern
in the other three functions. Ran `git checkout --` on the throwaway
local test-run data files afterward so no test output touched committed
production data.

Committed as `d92b1de`, pushed to main, triggered `gh workflow run
cve-alerts.yml` (run 34306771292) — completed `success` in 1m8s with no new
warnings/errors (only the pre-existing benign Node 20 deprecation notice).
Pulled latest and curled the live site: `https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/`
→ 200, `https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/data/stats.json` → 200. No
frontend files changed, so no browser/screenshot check was needed. Live
verification passed; no revert needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none — the one candidate identified cleared the bar
and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles = 0/3.
Not stopped. Next cycle in ~30 minutes.
