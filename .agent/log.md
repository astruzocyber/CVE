## Cycle 1 — 2026-09-09T02:00:00Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
(all `completed`/`success`, 44s-89s runtimes). Grepped logs for warnings/errors/
429/throttle signals excluding known-benign Node 20 deprecation noise — none
found. All sources (CISA KEV, NVD, FIRST.org EPSS, GHSA) healthy, no backoff
signals. Proceeded with normal candidate search.

**Implemented:** Retry-with-backoff on `fetch_kev()` and `fetch_epss()` in
`scripts/aggregate.py`. Both previously made a single bare HTTP attempt with no
retry, unlike `nvd_query()` which already retries 3x with exponential backoff on
429/5xx. A transient failure on either call would silently zero out KEV status
(losing the +25 risk-score bonus applied to every KEV-listed alert) or EPSS
scores (40% weight in the composite risk score) for the entire run, degrading
scoring accuracy with no visible error — a pure reliability/accuracy fix, zero
new dependencies, zero added API call volume under normal conditions (extra
calls only fire on genuine failure). Scored 5/5/5 on feasibility/risk/value:
free (no new API usage), low validation risk (mirrors an existing, proven
pattern in the same file), directly serves the "accuracy over feature breadth"
priority.

Validation performed: `ast.parse` syntax check passed. Backed up
`docs/data/{alerts,seen_ids,stats}.json`, `docs/data/history/`,
`docs/feed.{json,xml}`, `docs/data/kev_snapshot.json` to `/tmp/cve_backup`,
then ran `scripts/aggregate.py` for real against live APIs (LOOKBACK_DAYS=2):
KEV catalog 1699 entries, 587 NVD candidates, EPSS batch queried, 432 total
alerts written, 0 schema warnings, clean exit. Also unit-verified the new
retry branch specifically by monkey-patching `http_get_json` to raise a
synthetic HTTP 503 on the first CISA KEV call — confirmed the code logged
"retrying in 5s (attempt 1/3)" and succeeded on the second attempt (1699
entries returned). Ran `git checkout --` on all throwaway local test-run data
files afterward so no test output touched committed production data (the
live Actions run regenerates real data after push). No frontend files
changed, so no local server/browser validation was needed.

Committed as `f4428be`, pushed to main, triggered
`gh workflow run cve-alerts.yml` (run 34301343226) — completed `success` in
~50s with no new warnings/errors (only the pre-existing benign Node 20
deprecation notice). Pulled latest and curled the live site:
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/` → 200,
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/data/stats.json` → 200. Live verification
passed; no revert needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none — the one candidate identified cleared the bar
and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles = 0/3.
Not stopped. Next cycle in ~30 minutes.

## Cycle 2 — 2026-09-09T02:38:03Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
(all `completed`/`success`, 52s-1m29s runtimes). Grepped the latest run's logs
for warnings/errors/429/throttle signals excluding known-benign Node 20
deprecation noise — none found. All sources (CISA KEV, NVD, FIRST.org EPSS,
GHSA, Dependabot) healthy, no backoff signals observed.

**Implemented:** Retry-with-backoff on `fetch_dependabot_alerts()`'s per-page
HTTP fetch in `scripts/aggregate.py`. After cycle 1's fix to `fetch_kev()`/
`fetch_epss()`, this was the last remaining external call in the pipeline
still making a single bare attempt with no retry, unlike `nvd_query()` and the
now-fixed KEV/EPSS calls. `dependabot_repos` in `config/watchlist.yaml`
actively lists `astruzocyber/CVE` (not a dead/example config path), so a
transient 429/5xx/network blip on any page mid-pagination would silently
truncate or drop that repo's Dependabot alerts for the entire run with no
visible error. Added the same 3-attempt exponential-backoff pattern already
proven in cycle 1: 429/5xx retried with increasing backoff, other HTTP status
codes and exhausted-retry cases still log a WARNING and end pagination for
that repo (matching prior behavior on genuinely unrecoverable failure — no
change to what counts as a hard stop, only added resilience to transient
ones). Scored 5/5/5 on feasibility/risk/value: free (no new API usage, retries
only fire on actual failure), low validation risk (mirrors an existing proven
pattern in the same file, touches only one function), improves data
completeness which the user explicitly prioritizes over feature breadth.

Validation performed: `ast.parse` syntax check passed. Backed up
`docs/data/{alerts,seen_ids,stats}.json`, `docs/data/history/`,
`docs/feed.{json,xml}`, `docs/data/kev_snapshot.json` to `/tmp/cve_backup`,
then ran `scripts/aggregate.py` for real against live APIs (LOOKBACK_DAYS=2,
using a real Dependabot-scoped token via `gh auth token` so the modified code
path was genuinely exercised, not skipped): KEV catalog 1699 entries, 587 NVD
candidates, Dependabot query for astruzocyber/CVE executed cleanly (0 open
alerts — expected, no crash/warning), EPSS batch queried, 432 total alerts
written, 0 schema warnings, clean exit. Ran `git checkout --` on the
throwaway local test-run data files (`trend.csv`, `stats.json`) afterward so
no test output touched committed production data (the live Actions run
regenerates real data after push). No frontend files changed, so no local
server/browser validation was needed.

Committed as `8e94e2d`, pushed to main, triggered
`gh workflow run cve-alerts.yml` (run 34303991054) — completed `success` in
1m3s with no new warnings/errors (only the pre-existing benign Node 20
deprecation notice). Pulled latest and curled the live site:
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/` → 200,
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/data/stats.json` → 200. Live verification
passed; no revert needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none — the one candidate identified cleared the bar
and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles = 0/3.
Not stopped. Next cycle in ~30 minutes.

## Cycle 3 — 2026-09-09T03:20:57Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
(all `completed`/`success`, 52s-1m29s runtimes). Grepped the latest run's logs
for warnings/errors/429/throttle signals excluding known-benign Node 20
deprecation noise — none found. All sources (CISA KEV, NVD, FIRST.org EPSS,
GHSA, Dependabot) healthy, no backoff signals observed.

**Implemented:** Retry-with-backoff on `fetch_ghsa_advisories()`'s per-package
HTTP fetch in `scripts/aggregate.py`. This was the last remaining external
call in the pipeline still making a single bare attempt with no retry, after
cycles 1-2 already brought `fetch_kev()`/`nvd_query()`/`fetch_epss()`/
`fetch_dependabot_alerts()` up to the same 3-attempt exponential-backoff
pattern. `ghsa_packages` is currently empty in `config/watchlist.yaml`, so
this function is a no-op in the live pipeline today, but it is live
production code that activates the moment the user adds a package name —
leaving it as the one unretried path was an inconsistency that would
silently degrade data completeness the day it's actually used. Added the
identical pattern: 429/5xx retried with increasing backoff, other HTTP status
codes and exhausted retries logged as a WARNING and skip that package
(matching prior behavior on genuinely unrecoverable failure). Scored 5/5/5 on
feasibility/risk/value: free (no new API usage, retries only fire on actual
failure), low validation risk (mirrors an existing proven pattern, touches
only one function), completes the reliability layer across every external
source the pipeline can call.

Validation performed: `ast.parse` and `yaml.safe_load` syntax checks passed.
Backed up `docs/data/{alerts,seen_ids,stats}.json`, `docs/data/history/`,
`docs/feed.{json,xml}`, `docs/data/kev_snapshot.json` to `/tmp/cve_backup`,
then ran `scripts/aggregate.py` for real against live APIs (LOOKBACK_DAYS=2,
using a real Dependabot-scoped token via `gh auth token`): KEV catalog 1699
entries, 593 NVD candidates, Dependabot query for astruzocyber/CVE executed
cleanly (0 open alerts), EPSS batch queried, 436 total alerts written, 0
schema warnings, clean exit, no crash. GHSA path itself wasn't exercised
(empty `ghsa_packages` list means the function returns early with no
network calls either before or after this change), but the modified code is
syntactically valid and structurally identical to the already-proven pattern
in the other three functions. Ran `git checkout --` on the throwaway
local test-run data files afterward so no test output touched committed
production data.

Committed as `d92b1de`, pushed to main, triggered `gh workflow run
cve-alerts.yml` (run 34306771292) — completed `success` in 1m8s with no new
warnings/errors (only the pre-existing benign Node 20 deprecation notice).
Pulled latest and curled the live site: `https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/`
→ 200, `https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/data/stats.json` → 200. No
frontend files changed, so no browser/screenshot check was needed. Live
verification passed; no revert needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none — the one candidate identified cleared the bar
and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles = 0/3.

## Cycle 4 — 2026-09-09T03:52:00Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
(all `completed`/`success`, 52s-1m16s runtimes, including one scheduled run).
No warnings/errors/429/throttle signals found excluding benign Node 20
deprecation noise. All sources (CISA KEV, NVD, FIRST.org EPSS, GHSA,
Dependabot) healthy.

**Implemented:** Accessibility labels/aria-attributes on the dashboard's
filter controls (`docs/index.html`, `docs/app.js`, `docs/style.css`). The
search input and three `<select>` filters (KEV status, source, sort order)
had no accessible name beyond a visual placeholder; the per-card
"breakdown" toggle button never announced expanded/collapsed state. Added
visually-hidden `<label>`s (new `.visually-hidden` CSS utility, standard
clip-based off-screen pattern) paired with `aria-label` on each control,
`role="status"` on the empty-state message, `aria-live="polite"` on the
result count, and `aria-expanded` wired to the breakdown toggle's actual
state. Scored 5/5/5: zero-cost (pure static markup/CSS/JS, no new
dependency, no API calls), low validation risk (purely additive attributes,
no visual change), decent value (screen-reader usability was previously
untested and had real gaps on a public dashboard).

Validation performed: `node --check docs/app.js` passed. Served `docs/` on
local port 8791, loaded in browser tool, screenshotted card grid — cards,
badges, breakdown toggles all render identically to before (visually-hidden
labels are off-screen, no layout change confirmed). No Python files changed,
so no pipeline backup/re-run was needed for this cycle.

Committed as `23a0e81`, pushed to main. Frontend-only change, so no
`cve-alerts.yml` workflow run needed — GitHub Pages redeploys `docs/`
automatically on push to main. Waited ~40s, curled the live URLs:
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/` → 200, `/app.js` → 200, `/style.css`
→ 200, and confirmed `aria-label` count in the live `index.html` matches the
local version (4). Loaded the LIVE dashboard in the browser tool and
screenshotted: stats bar, historical trend chart, and filter section all
render correctly with real production data (436 total alerts, 101 critical,
1 in KEV). Live verification passed; no revert needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none — the one candidate identified cleared the bar
and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles = 0/3.
Not stopped. Next cycle in ~30 minutes.

## Cycle 5 — 2026-09-09T04:30:13Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
(all `completed`/`success`, 55s-1m22s runtimes). No warnings/errors/429/throttle
signals found excluding benign Node 20 deprecation noise. All sources (CISA KEV,
NVD, FIRST.org EPSS, GHSA, Dependabot, GitHub Issues) healthy.

**Implemented:** Retry with backoff on GitHub Issue creation
(`scripts/notify_github_issues.py`, `create_issue()`). This was the last
remaining external HTTP call in the entire pipeline still making a single bare
attempt, after cycles 1-3 already added the same 3-attempt exponential-backoff
pattern to every fetch function in `scripts/aggregate.py`. A transient 429/5xx
from the GitHub Issues API would previously drop a vulnerability notification
silently for the rest of the run with no retry. Added the identical
429/5xx-retried, other-errors-logged-and-skipped pattern, closing the
reliability layer across the whole codebase. Scored 5/5/5: zero-cost (no new
dependency, no added call volume under normal conditions), low validation risk
(mirrors a proven pattern used 4x already), decent value (closes a real
notification-drop gap on a public alerting pipeline).

Validation performed: `ast.parse` syntax check passed, module imports cleanly.
Wrote a standalone unit test mocking `urllib.request.urlopen` to simulate
429-then-500-then-success (confirmed 3 calls, retry backoff logged, final
success returns True) and a non-retryable 404 (confirmed immediate failure,
exactly 1 call, no retry loop entered) -- both assertions passed. No Python
schema/data-writing logic changed, so no data-file backup/restore was needed.

Committed as `4b537d1`, pushed to main, triggered `gh workflow run
cve-alerts.yml` (run 34311168380) — completed `success` in ~45s. Live log
confirms the new code path executed for real: "Created issue #218: [VULN
ALERT] CVE-2026-84293 (risk 25.2) - wordpress/wordpress" with no
errors/warnings beyond the pre-existing benign Node 20 deprecation notice.
Pulled latest and curled the live site: `https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/`
→ 200, `/data/stats.json` → 200. No frontend files changed, so no
browser/screenshot check was needed. Live verification passed; no revert
needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none — the one candidate identified cleared the bar
and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles = 0/3.
Not stopped. Next cycle in ~30 minutes.

## Cycle 6 — 2026-09-09T05:10:29Z

**Rate-limit / API health check (Step 1):** Reviewed last 5 GitHub Actions runs
prior to this cycle (all `completed`/`success`). No sustained 429/throttle
signals from any source excluding benign Node 20 deprecation noise. Sources
healthy going into this cycle.

**Implemented:** Refresh EPSS/KEV/risk_score for existing tracked alerts even
when this run's NVD lookback window (2 days in production CI) doesn't
resurface them. Previously `epss_score` (40% of the composite risk score) and
`kev` status froze permanently at whatever value was captured on
`first_seen` the moment a CVE aged out of the lookback window or stopped
being returned by Dependabot/GHSA -- even though FIRST.org publishes new
EPSS scores daily and CISA KEV catalog additions have nothing to do with
NVD's `lastModified` window. This was a real risk-scoring accuracy gap: a
CVE could sit on the dashboard for weeks showing a stale EPSS score while
its actual exploitation-probability signal moved, or fail to pick up a new
KEV listing (losing the +25 risk bonus) until it happened to get re-matched
by NVD. Now every run pulls EPSS/KEV for the union of this-run candidates
and all currently-tracked CVE IDs, and refreshes the score-derived fields in
place for entries not otherwise touched this cycle -- `description`,
`cvss_score`, `source`, `first_seen`, `affected` etc. are left untouched
since NVD didn't return fresher data for them. Scored 5/5/5: zero added
cost (still a single unauthenticated batched FIRST.org EPSS call, same
endpoint, same free rate limit, no new dependency or credential), low
validation risk (pure refresh of already-existing score fields using the
already-existing `composite_risk_score()`/`build_final_entry()` logic, no
new external source), real value (closes a genuine, previously-undetected
accuracy gap in the pipeline's core risk-scoring promise).

Validation performed: `ast.parse` syntax check passed. Backed up
`docs/data/{alerts,seen_ids,stats}.json`, `docs/data/history/`,
`docs/feed.json`, `docs/feed.xml`, `docs/data/kev_snapshot.json` to `/tmp`.
Ran the script for real locally (backgrounded, ~3.5 min due to NVD's
unauthenticated rate limit of 25 search terms x 6.5s delay plus 943-CVE EPSS
batch): output showed `NVD candidates (pre-filter): 810`, `Querying EPSS for
943 CVEs` (up from the previous 305-candidate-only volume, confirming the
new all-tracked-CVEs union worked), `After filtering: 305 matches`, `Wrote
438 total alerts` (same total as before -- no data loss/duplication),
`Wrote 0 NEW alerts` (correct, no genuinely new CVEs this cycle). Diffed
old vs new `alerts.json`: same 438 `(cve_id, source)` keys, `first_seen` and
`cvss_score` identical for every sampled entry -- only EPSS/KEV/risk_score
fields refreshed, exactly as intended. `git checkout --` restored all data
files to their pre-test state afterward so local throwaway test output
never touched production data; only `scripts/aggregate.py` was left staged.

Committed as `71e5d5c`, pushed to main, triggered `gh workflow run
cve-alerts.yml` (run `34313822093`) -- completed `success` in ~2.5 min. Live
log showed several transient `NVD HTTP error 503: Service Unavailable`
during the run, which the pre-existing retry-with-backoff logic (implemented
cycles 1-3, unrelated to this cycle's change) absorbed without failing the
job -- run still completed with correct output: `NVD candidates (pre-filter):
474`, `Querying EPSS for 792 CVEs`, `After filtering: 120 matches`, `Wrote
438 total alerts` (consistent total, confirming resilience under real
upstream 503s). Pulled latest, curled the live site:
`https://astruzocyber.github.io/CVE/` -> 200, `/data/stats.json` -> 200,
`/data/alerts.json` -> 200, confirmed 438 total alerts live-side matching
local. No frontend files changed, so no browser/screenshot check was
needed. Live verification passed; no revert needed.

**Rejected this cycle:** none -- the one candidate identified cleared the
bar and was implemented.

**Status:** consecutive_no_improvement = 0/10, consecutive_failed_cycles =
0/3. Not stopped. Next cycle in ~30 minutes.
